# ComputerNetworks
Lab exercises for the Computer Network course in the 7th semester at ECE school ntua 2023-2024.
The lab exercises cover network structure, network protocols (IP, ARP, ICMP, TCP, UDP),
application protocols (FTP, TFTP, TELNET, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMTP), use of protocol analysis tools and performance measurement. 
We used the wireshark tool for capturing and analyzing data, packets etc. Most of the labs were executed on linux and some parts of them on windows.
